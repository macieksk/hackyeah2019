    "# Getting started with Word2Vec in Gensim and making it work!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind Word2Vec is pretty simple. We are making and assumption that you can tell the meaning of a word by the company it keeps. This is analogous to the saying *show me your friends, and I'll tell who you are*. So if you have two words that have very similar neighbors (i.e. the usage context is about the same), then these words are probably quite similar in meaning or are at least highly related. For example, the words `shocked`,`appalled` and `astonished` are typically used in a similar context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Gensim implementation of Word2Vec and actually get it to work! I have heard a lot of complaints about poor performance etc, but its really a combination of two things, (1) your input data and (2) your parameter settings. Note that the training algorithms in this package were ported from the [original Word2Vec implementation by Google](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) and extended with additional functionality."

    "### Dataset \n",
    "Next, is our dataset. The secret to getting Word2Vec really working for you is to have lots and lots of text data. In this case I am going to use data from the [OpinRank](http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-ranking-data/) dataset. This dataset has full user reviews of cars and hotels. I have specifically concatenated all of the hotel reviews into one big file which is about 97MB compressed and 229MB uncompressed. We will use the compressed file for this tutorial. Each line in this file represents a hotel review. You can download the OpinRank Word2Vec dataset here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion, while gensim’s word2vec tutorial says that you need to pass it a sequence of sentences as its input, you can always pass it a whole review as a sentence (i.e. a much larger size of text), and it should not make much of a difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a closer look at this data below by printing the first line. You can see that this is a pretty hefty review."

      "\n",
      "in november google invited several outside experts to ponder what to do with wave the company had two options the flop could either be locked away in its code vault the company trying hard to forget about all the money and effort that went into it or it could be given away in the hope that someone could do something useful with it after week discussion google decided to cede wave fully to apache software foundation non profit open source volunteer driven developer community apache is now wave rightful owner\n",

      "software is usually created as text written in particular programming language this can run to hundreds of thousands of lines for big programs and millions in the case of operating systems another program called compiler turns this text known as the source code into an executable file such as an exe on windows but if you want to tinker with the program to fix bugs for example or to update it you need the source code it is the most valuable thing owned by any software company the equivalent of coca cola magic formula\n",

      "\n",
      "as we note in this week print edition the most common roads to oblivion are physical decay of the medium in which the data are stored format changes and software updates that render files unreadable it took small band of digital archaeologists to extract the information from mr mechner old discs but there are more quotidian ways to lose information big risk for companies that use custom made software is that the provider may go out of business taking the source code with it\n",
      "one option is for the developers to hand over the source code to the customer but they may not want to part with their intellectual property and the customer may not want to pay the extra sums involved in acquiring it the other option is to put the source code in software escrow the customer and the developer agree to store copy of the source code with neutral third party such as data management company this allows the developer to protect intellectual property while giving the customer something to fall back on\n",
      "\n",
      "despite the best intentions of programmers giving software away can be tricky getting the creator the development studio and the publisher to agree to waive their rights is long and sometimes fruitless process another problem is that the code for one work may contain bits of other works when google agreed to donate wave to apache it had first to strip it bare parts of wave can be found in google docs but it is to google credit and that of messrs mechner and carmack that they were willing to brave the legal and technical wrangles to make their work available to all other developers would do well to follow in their footsteps\n",

    "\n",
    "Training the model is fairly straightforward. You just instantiate Word2Vec and pass the reviews that we read in the previous step (the `documents`). So, we are essentially passing on a list of lists. Where each list within the main list contains a set of tokens from a user review. Word2Vec uses all these tokens to internally create a vocabulary. And by vocabulary, I mean a set of unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "After building the vocabulary, we just need to call `train(...)` to start training the Word2Vec model. Training on the [OpinRank](http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-ranking-data/) dataset takes about 10 minutes so please be patient while running your code on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes we are actually training a simple neural network with a single hidden layer. But, we are actually not going to use the neural network after training. Instead, the goal is to learn the weights of the hidden layer. These weights are essentially the word vectors that we’re trying to learn. "
