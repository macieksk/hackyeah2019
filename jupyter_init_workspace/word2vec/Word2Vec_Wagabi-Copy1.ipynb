    "The idea behind Word2Vec is pretty simple. We are making and assumption that you can tell the meaning of a word by the company it keeps. This is analogous to the saying *show me your friends, and I'll tell who you are*. So if you have two words that have very similar neighbors (i.e. the usage context is about the same), then these words are probably quite similar in meaning or are at least highly related. For example, the words `shocked`,`appalled` and `astonished` are typically used in a similar context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Gensim implementation of Word2Vec and actually get it to work! I have heard a lot of complaints about poor performance etc, but its really a combination of two things, (1) your input data and (2) your parameter settings. Note that the training algorithms in this package were ported from the [original Word2Vec implementation by Google](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) and extended with additional functionality."

In this case I am going to use data from the [OpinRank](http://kavita-ganesan.com/entity-ranking-data/) dataset. This dataset has full user reviews of cars and hotels. I have specifically concatenated all of the hotel reviews into one big file which is about 97MB compressed and 229MB uncompressed. We will use the compressed file for this tutorial. Each line in this file represents a hotel review. You can download the OpinRank Word2Vec dataset here.\n",

A time for the people to express themselves freely and to be heard from anywhere across the world without hindrance from their government. The people of France were upset and have taken direct action by hitting their streets wearing Yellow Vests demanding change. Behind their frustrations were, the tax hike on fuel, upset about minimum wage, upset about how their countries current pension plans were being handled, restoring taxes for the ultra-wealthy, disability allowances, ending outsourcing of jobs, making any elected representative pay be the median national salary, counting of blank ballots, and a better voting system to name a few of the fifty nine demands. The French believe that their government has a self-serving position and not a vision of the people. The world is listening and has heard the citizens of France battle cry and countries all over have either joined online in support or have taken to the streets and joined the war for the people. Anonymous has seen the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, and many other countries joining in solidarity of the Yellow Vests. The United States of America as well as Canada has seen the success of the French and are planning their own direct actions. We have seen multiple locations, all over the continent, being formulated for both December 22nd as well as January 1st. The list of demand that they are seeking includes: ending homelessness, putting a limit on campaign contributions and spending, an increase to minimum wage, indexing of salary and pensions based off of inflation, job creation for the unemployed, consistent care for military veterans, ending the privatization of prisons, and ending endless wars. Both Canadians and Americans are tired of the toil, suffering, and being forced to sell their labor power. If citizens of a country believe that their governments motive is to profit interests and not the maintenance and betterment of the population, to meeting human needs, then that society should not stand. It should be challenged and questioned, and overthrown. Anonymous believes there have been and will be further changes in the way the world is organized, so that nevermore will small groups of people be able to restrain the fundamental freedoms of the collective that is humankind. For if only we decide to make it so, it will be done. When attempting to challenge an existing order, the voice of the discontented masses calling for social change must be as loud or more effective as the voice of concentrated power promising stability to the masses. Attacks on the freedom of speech and hindering information flow from your citizens will not be tolerated. Any organization involved in censoring the Yellow Vests will be targeted. Oppressive governments of the world take this as a warning: Anonymous has been watching recent developments in each and every country that has decided enough is enough and decided to link arms with its neighboring Yellow Vested countries. If you choose to silence your people, swift action will be taken. This war, just like Arab Spring is and will continue to be waged. To the citizens of the world, you are not alone. We sunk our teeth into the Tunisian government for its citizens and we will sink our teeth into other countries, if they do not listen to their peoples demands. The events of these times will be the printed words that our children will come to read. Just as Anonymous is but an idea, so is the Yellow Vests, crafted in the lust of hope. Just as Anonymous speaks, so does the Yellow Vest movement, their words ring true. Just as we seen in Tunisia during Arab Spring and in France, there are always possibilities of the oppressors becoming violent to maintain their power. If you believe your government will use force upon you to accept their beliefs Anonymous asks you to be prepared. Things we have seen brought in both France and Tunisia were milk of Magnesia, Water, multiple layers of clothing, a first aid kit, and two-way radios. If you feel there is a chance of possible arrest, write down somewhere on you your National Lawyers Guild number or agencies such as the ACLU. Join us as we join the Yellow Vests on December 22nd and January 1st. Let your children and your children's children be proud of the fact that you were a part of the Western Winter revolution that changed the world. \\n\",\n",

       "  'They came in the form of a little pill, and they were originally produced by scientists hell bent on playing god and improving people artificially… by implanting knowledge in their heads, only temporarily. But gradually, as the illegal doses on the street got higher and higher, they released a permanency of the effect upon the user; a sort of halfway house, where they were affected but not affected at the same time, sometimes just sinking into a vegetative state and sometimes actually alternating between normal and ‘high’. \\n',\n",
       "  'It was a bad idea to give it to general public as a test. Soon there were formulae being passed from hand to hand, improvements being made, and people paying more and more for an impure sample of the stuff. \\n',\n",
       "  'Pretty soon there were all types on the market; Most of them based around languages, since it was the easiest to work with. French students would pay anything up to £150 just for half an hour’s worth of ‘frenchies’, or pills that made you speak fluent French, only for them to realise once they got into the exam that they could no longer understand the English instructions on the front page. German students were trying out ‘germs’ and those studying Spanish would pay upwards of £500 for a set of ‘Spaniards’ which not only made you speak fluent Spanish, but left you with your ability to speak in English as well, as an interesting side effect. Nobody knew why it was only Spanish that had this effect. \\n',\n",
       "  'The purer the pill, the more refined the speaking style was. A pure frenchie would make a Frenchman believe he was talking to one of his own kind, while a dirty one, often mixed with sugar and watered down, would leave you as advanced as a schoolboy; understandable, but imperfect. \\n',\n",
       "  'Well it was only a matter of time before people were creating drug cocktails, mixes that allowed them to have an even wider range of knowledge; frenchies were mixed with Spaniards so that they could speak French and English at the same time. Unfortunately the effects were often far from desirable, sometimes leaving the user unable to speak anything but gobbledygook, and in very rare situations leaving the user speaking fluent Basque.\\n',\n",
       "  'Soon the formulae were improved and Latinos and Russkies began appearing on the scene. Grecos were the next addition, and there was a brief revival of dead languages, until Hindies and Japs were brought onto the scene and everybody became decidedly eastern. \\n',\n",
       "  'Japs became particularly popular with artists who were intrigued by the whole written language and became obsessed with the Kanji. There was a sudden tidal wave of paintings based around Japanese calligraphy that passed as quickly as is began after the next drug came on the scene. \\n',\n",
       "  'And what a drug it was. The ability to speak every language in the world was invented, and it suddenly became the craze. Frenchies and Spaniards were still being sold, but only to the connoisseurs, who enjoyed the finer quality of conversation available from the pure versions. \\n',\n",
       "  'The muddy mixed pill was a temporary obsession to the backstreet ravers; suddenly people were flirting in Hebrew and picking up phone numbers written in roman numerals. The whole world was forced into central London for a night, before being squeezed back out by a good morning’s sleep. \\n',\n",
       "  'Gradually, the pills were dropped, and people went back to their ordinary lives. There were still the faithful few who became so addicted that the effect on them was almost permanent, and there were those who had stuck to one type all the way making good livings as language teachers. \\n',\n",
       "  'There were very few who were sticking with the universal pills, and they were looked down on by the elite for being impure and dirty. Still, in the gutters of side streets there were those who were continuing with their routines, unable to stick to one language, constantly flitting mid-sentence from English to French to Hebrew to Hindi to Russian to Italian… and they were completely unintelligible, unable to make their minds up, unsure as to their first language, and never sure which to stick with. \\n',\n",
       "  \"The problem is that after a while, all languages become foreign to you, each just as imperfect as the last, and in order to express yourself, express that particular shade of anger you're feeling with that Russian word, or describe the type of snow in Inuit, you keep on flitting between languages, floating amongst the words and touching gently on their letters and symbols and alphabets before taking flight into another deep, unrecognisable dialect.

My real start came in Oct 2017 when I decided to sub an account and go fully into what EVE has to offer. I started off in Pandemic Horde and stayed there for quite a while. Learn pretty much the basics of fleet mechanics as well as how to survive in a hostile space. I was also pretty much searching for players in my home countries that I could play with (same TZ) and that is how I met Ledan. With Null sec feeling like everyone doing their own thing (Krabbing nonstop), I decided to give Low sec a try to brush up my PVP skills. The timing was also just right in that I got an invite from Adarxx to join his newly set up corp (Going in Dry.) that’s base in Genesis after flying with him for a bit. \\n',\n",

Basically, we just created our own content and try to be the best low sec pirate we can be. Our main foe in Genesis was a group called White sky(3better super hunters). White sky lived near us and we had some good fights where we managed to dunk a few of their rorquals with the help of shadow cartel and PL. LSH was also around the area and we also had some good fights from time to time thou we don’t normally escalate with WS or LSH due to them having a much bigger capital fleet. \\n',\n",

I left the corp due to a diplomatic incident where there was one time when we are reinforcing White Sky structure, they bat phone UFC and LSH to come and defend. So I shot a LSH fax (Blue to Alliance) on grid because FC was not blue(Combine ops with multiple entity) with LSH thereby having their killmail on the alliance killboard. \\n',\n",

Was bouncing around for one month before I joined up with Shadow Cartel. It was fun being there because it was a different part of low sec where there were more “readied” PVP action.

From a young age, it was obvious that she was different, by she didn\\'t realize to what extent. She liked playing outside and with bugs; she would chop her hair with safety scissors; she didn\\'t like to hang out with other kids. Everyone at school never really liked her because of her odd behavior, but Quinn didn\\'t really mind. She had herself, and that\\'s all that mattered. When she was five, her little sister was born. This is when her stepfather\\'s drinking began to get out of hand. He began to throw Quinn out of the house because she was \"too strange for the Zhou family\", and she spent most of her days in the garage, tinkering with tools and gadgets. The garage became her home, and the gagdets made her feel safe and happy. One day, while she was attempting to build a robot, she got shocked by the wires she had in her hands. She got shocked all the time; this was nothing new. However, this time, the current seemed to go THROUGH her. It was as if she had absorbed the shock. Quinn was of course surprised and confused, but unfortunately, she wasn\\'t the only one to see this. Her little sister had seen it as well, and she immediately ran and told their parents. Her mother didn\\'t seem to mind, but her stepfather was appalled. He was a known hater of powers. From that day on, Quinn was barely allowed inside of the house, and she was punished severely for her mistakes, no matter how small. She was even physically and verbally abused at times, along with her mother and sister. She was sent to the island so she could learn how to use her powers, but also so her stepfather wouldn\\'t have to deal with her.\\n',\n",

Because of this, she know always releases her energy all at once and doesn't hold back. She is also very impulsive: taking risks whenever she can; doing things without thinking; saying her feelings without considering others. Now that she is finally allowed to express herself, she does it whenever possible. She often doesn't think about things before she does them, and because of that, some people can get hurt because of that. Most see her as annoying as well, but she doesn't care; she doesn't care about what others think, and she is very good at ignoring mean comments. She is also very loyal; because she is not used to having friends so whenever she has one, she sticks up for them and supports them unconditionally. Quinn can also be very silly at times, and has a sort of childish side to her. (This is because she had to learn to fend for herself from an early age, so she never really got the chance to be innocent.) However, Quinn is also a very closed-off person and doesn't express her true emotions very often.

Arguably, the most accurate term for this form of harassment would be “counterintelligence stalking.” Agents of communist East Germany’s Stasi (state police) referred to the process as Zersetzung (German for “decomposition” or “corrosion” – a reference to the severe psychological, social, and financial effects upon the victim). American and British victims have described the process as “no-touch torture” – a phrase which also captures the nature of the crime: cowardly, unethical (and often illegal), but difficult to prove legally because it generates minimal forensic evidence.\\n',\n",

And they write down minute-by-minute details of everything they do—if they go to the bathroom, if they change clothes, if they, as you said, touch their face, and anyone they interact with, and details about what kind of phone they have.

From 1986 to 2008 there was a fivefold increase in the number of border patrol officers.\\n',\n",

       "  'Dar El-Nimer for Arts and Culture presents A National Monument, an exhibition by Visualizing Palestine and Marwan Rechmaoui. Inspired by a series of highly detailed maps of Palestine from the British Mandate period, the main installation recreates a 3-dimensional snapshot of the major Palestinian cities and towns circa 1947, based on the final British surveys before the Nakba. The installation consists of over 30 3-dimensional pieces derived from the original maps and topographic data from NASA. The exhibition also features prints from a series of 1:20,000 topo-cadastral maps from the 1940s, and other works by Visualizing Palestine, including Palestine Open Maps, an online platform for exploring past and present maps of Palestine.\\n',\n",
       "  \"This collaboration was initiated by Ahmad Barclay, a long time partner with Visualizing Palestine, building on an ongoing vision to build partnerships with practitioners across art, design and cultural disciplines. The title 'A National Monument' is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the words of J. F. Salmon, director of the Palestine Survey (1933-38), who once wrote: 'A good topographical survey should be looked upon as a national monument of the first importance.' Words that take on unintended new meanings in light of the dramatic transformation of the territory over the past seven decades.\\n\",\n",

The trainers in the game don't really have a set personality as they are suppose to ghost the player who is playing the character, so the personality of May isn't canonical to anything.

She does go through the region doing both contests and gym battles, for there is no reason for her to not do the other league as she is traversing the region of Hoenn.  A lot of scenes will rely on her encountering other trainers or Pokemon along her journey that may or may not be local to the region she is in. Early on in her journey, May is someone who isn't much of a risk taker and actually wants to take things a bit slower while still being able to enjoy the journey that she took on. As she gets wiser through her journey she is willing to make more risks and take on challenges that she may or may not be able to actually tackle on. She is a nice trainer, but she can be rather competitive and even turn into a bit of a brat when dealing with a rival. She can be a bit pety at times, but doesn't do anything to jeopardize herself or others. She makes for a good protagonist because she is a model character who others should aspire to be by the end of her journey as she has faced several legendary Pokemon, has a strong team that defeated some of the strongest trainers, and is a good representation of the Hoenn region. \\n\",\n",

There needs to be some canon alteration in order to create a more sexualized world for May to be going into which causes there to be kinkier and more sexual encounters. There are a lot of other variables that will need to be determined for each scene such as what body type May has, how much of a pervert she is, is she submissive or dominant, is she corrupted or no? A lot of things can happen with May and the Pokemon universe and I don't want to limit it to one narrative. It does make May feel like she is a hub profile in the sense the setting and characters sexuality are something to be determined within the scene, but I'd rather do that than be limited in what to do. \\n\",\n",

Completely bypasses physical defenses and instead is affected by magical defenses, the weapon reverts to normal after a single swing.

Corvus regains stamiina proportionate to the length of time spent in contact. After, Corvus' demeanor is affected by his partner's personality temporarily. He also gains a random physically mockable temporary skill from his partner. Auras are copyable, but not spells.

Corvus can now retain 2 mocked skills for up to two days.(Stage 3:) Corvus' Stamina is ALWAYS maxed by resonance, he restores HP instead. He can retain three mock skills for up to three days.

For example, if you had tags for a million stackoverflow questions and answers, you could find tags that are related to a given tag and recommend the related ones for exploration. You can do this by treating each set of co-occuring tags as a \"sentence\" and train a Word2Vec model on this data. Granted, you still need a large number of examples to make it work. \n"
